<h4 id="what-are-the-features-of-multimedia">What are the features of multimedia?</h4>
<p>The characteristics of media technology include: diversity, integration, interactivity
In terms of data transmission requirements, it will vary depending on the data</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-special-requirements-when-transmitting-multimedia">What are the special requirements when transmitting multimedia?</h4>
<p>It is necessary to use network transmission. In order to avoid the burden of excessive data transmission and increase the storage capacity of the computer, data compression is required, and different forms of multimedia (pictures, videos, and sounds) also have various protocols.</p>
<h4 id="please-list-the-information-services-and-equipment-that-can-be-called-multimedia-communication-in-the-surrounding-environment">Please list the information services and equipment that can be called multimedia communication in the surrounding environment:</h4>
<p>I think that the most commonly used ibon machines in supermarkets nowadays are very convenient for printing, paying bills, storing value, and purchasing tickets. Next, it should be the smart phone that is currently carried around, which can carry out various information service functions.</p>
<h4 id="choose-a-multimedia-communication-application-collect-relevant-information-and-explain-its-development-status-and-future-trends">Choose a multimedia communication application, collect relevant information, and explain its development status and future trends</h4>
<p>Application of wireless sensor network: For example, the development status of RFID and ZigBee is applied to wireless embedded (sensing) network or logistics supply chain management system. The future trend will be more targeted by industry players. Improve the processing and distribution of the collected data in the supply chain management system, as well as the technology development related to data security, the identification and screening of sensing signals, and the communication with the back-end database server.</p>

<p>I think the impact of the video conference system on distance teaching must be positive. It makes it easier for teachers to manage student dynamics, and also has complete message boards and video functions, and can transplant the model of physical classes to online distance teaching to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Other uses of video conferencing, I think the progress of the Internet now, it is not like the past to reunite, it must spend a lot of time to move, although there will be a lack of part of the feeling of actual meeting, but like the current severe epidemic period, it has slowed down to a certain extent. It meets the social needs that people need to meet, and achieves the effect of calming people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-streaming-in-multimedia-applications">What are the advantages of streaming in multimedia applications?</h4>
<p>Streaming refers to compressing a series of images and sending them to the client stably and quickly. When the protocol is enabled, you can save space without saving files on the client.</p>
<h4 id="please-explain-the-difference-between-unicast-and-multicast-broadband-usage">Please explain the difference between unicast and multicast broadband usage</h4>
<p>Unicast technically requires that the MAC addresses of the NLB network interfaces of the two hosts of the two computers be exactly the same, so that the two hosts cannot connect to each other.</p>
<p>Multicast messages are delivered to a group of destination addresses at the same time. It uses a strategy that is most efficient because messages only need to be delivered once per network line, and messages are only replicated when lines fork.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-the-routing-mechanism-needed-in-the-multicast-protocol">Why is the routing mechanism needed in the multicast protocol?</h4>
<p>The IP address used by multicast has a specific format, so once the network node finds that there is a multicast address in the packet, it will use the multicast processing method. The main problem is routing. Routers that support multicast Routing is established through the information provided by IGMP. There are many methods of multicast routing, including PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast), DVMRP (Distance-Vector Multicast Routing Protocol), CBT (Core-Based Tree) and MOSPF (Multicast Open Shortest Path First) . Multicast routing also takes into account the distribution of users, so there are so-called dense mode and sparse mode. The network domain where the user is located is also one of the technical considerations.</p>
<h4 id="please-explain-how-the-agreement-on-quality-of-service-is-related-to-streaming-services">Please explain how the agreement on quality of service is related to streaming services?</h4>
<p>In order to ensure quality of service (QoS), several protocols have been developed specifically for QoS requirements. Among them, RSVP can reserve resources at the network edge (edge), MPLS can control traffic, and DiffServ can specify the priority order of packets. However, in the event of network overloading, these agreements still do not work.</p>
<h4 id="explain-the-difference-between-streaming-and-downloading">Explain the difference between streaming and downloading?</h4>
<p>Streaming can be imagined as downloading while playing. It is mainly different from downloading and playing. For downloading and playing, you need to download the file to the computer and then play it. This feature allows the file to be retained, but it also causes the loss of storage space.
For streaming, since the video is downloaded while playing, it does not need to be fully loaded to watch the video, and the file will not be saved on the local computer, but only exists in the form of temporary storage.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="what-is-spatial-and-temporal-redundancy">What is Spatial and Temporal Redundancy?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Temporal: In video data, there is usually a strong correlation between adjacent frames, and such correlation is redundant information in time. The redundant part of time is basically only a slight movement, but the actual video is similar.</li>
<li>Spatial: In the same frame, there is usually a strong correlation between adjacent pixels, which is the redundant information in space. Because each point in the video is often correlated, for example, in the video of a car, the colors of the opposite points are similar between the points in the car.</li>
<li>Statistical: Statistically redundant information means that the probability distribution of the symbol to be encoded is non-uniform.</li>

<h4 id="try-to-compare-the-differences-between-h261-and-h263">Try to compare the differences between H.261 and H.263.</h4>
<p>Application of H.261: for face-to-face video telephony and video conferencing.</p>
<p>Applications of H.263: H.263 was originally designed for transmission in H.324-based systems (ie, public switched telephone networks and other circuit-switched-based
network for video conferencing and video telephony).</p>
<p>Overview of H.261: H.261 is a video coding standard formulated by ITU-T in 1990 and belongs to a video codec.</p>
<p>Overview of H.263: H.263 is a low-bit-rate video coding standard for video conferencing formulated by ITU-T and belongs to a video codec.</p>
<p>Features of H.261: H.261 requires much less CPU computation than MPEG in real-time encoding. In order to optimize bandwidth usage, this algorithm introduces a trade-off mechanism between image quality and motion amplitude. That is, images that are vigorously moving are of poorer quality than relatively still images.</p>
<p>Features of H.263: Motion compensation in H.263 uses half-pixel precision, while H.261 uses full-pixel precision and loop filtering; some parts of the data stream hierarchy are optional in H.263, making Codecs can be configured for lower data rates or better error correction; H.263 includes four negotiable options to improve performance; H.263 uses unlimited motion vectors and syntax-based arithmetic coding.</p>
<p>The accuracy of H.263 Motion compensation can reach half-pixel accuracy;
This method is similar to the one used by MPEG, mainly because of the characteristics of human eye vision, let us
This method can be used to improve the accuracy of displacement estimation. Therefore, we can use the phase of the image in time
to compress the image more. Compared with H.261, there are only integer pixels ((Integer-pixel accuracy)
Overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC): After finding the most similar blocks using displacement estimation, the traditional method directly covers these blocks, and the estimated error value is added to form the current block. image.
However, in H.263, all current blocks will be the weighted average of the three blocks plus the error value, but the three blocks inside will have an adjacent relationship. So the size of the block has changed from the original 16x16 to 8x8. Therefore, the quality of the compressed image will be better, and it can also maintain a better compression ratio.</p>

<p>AVC is actually an alias for the H.264 protocol. But since the SVC part was added to the H.264 protocol, people used to call the part of the H.264 protocol that does not contain SVC as AVC, and the SVC part as SVC alone.
H.264 SVC (H.264 Scalable Coding) was originally developed by JVT in 2004 as an extension of the H.264 standard, and was approved by ITU in July 2007. H.264 SVC is based on the H.264 AVC video codec standard, and utilizes various efficient algorithm tools of the AVC codec. Expansion kits, and are extensible in terms of video quality, and can produce decoded video at different frame rates, resolutions or quality levels. Video quality can be adjusted. The video encoding quality is better. Single or multiple bit streams can be used. Better network adaptability.
When the quality of network transmission is poor, AVC cannot play the video in real time. Relatively, SVC can play the action with lower video quality. Although it cannot provide high-quality video, it improves the smoothness of video streaming.</p>

<p>ANS: When the server and the client want to transmit data, if an error occurs during the transmission of the message, the receiver will reply to the transmitter, and there are three common methods:
Stop-and-wait Automatic Repeat Request:</p>
<ul>

With some additional information, when the data received by the receiver is incomplete, it can be repaired and restored through the additional information.</p>
<p>advantage:
Some errors can be fixed without relying on server resend.</p>
<p>shortcoming:
Consume additional bandwidth and resources.</p>
<h4 id="please-explain-the-difference-between-packet-leavel-fec-and-byte-leavel-fec">Please explain the difference between Packet-Leavel FEC and Byte Leavel FEC?</h4>
<p>ANS: Byte-level FEC is the correcting codes, usually used in the physical layer. In FEC(n, k), n is the block size, which means that it contains k message symbols and n-k parity symbols to provide error correction at the decoding end. One symbol corresponds to For a set of bit sequences (such as bytes), it is impossible to know which symbols have errors, so correcting codes can only repair (n-k)/2 symbol errors at most. The general correcting codes cannot resist the occurrence of a large number of error bursts, so they are usually transmitted with interleaving, in order to disperse errors and reduce the impact of bursts.
Packet-level FEC is erasure codes, which are usually used in Transport or Application layer. In FEC(n, k), n is block size, including k data packets and n-k parity packets, because we can know which ones are above the IP layer. There is an error in the packets, so we use erasure codes, that is, assuming that MH can correctly receive any k packets out of n packets, any missing data packets will be correctly reconstructed.</p>
